# AI_for_Earth_Water-body_Classification

To understand the available water and water systems in the world, it is useful to classify water-bodies into categories that can give us some information regarding their characteristics.

Our project aims to classify the water-bodies identified in the RealSAT dataset using Machine Learning models, following on the work done by [Ravirathinam et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364516705_Spatiotemporal_Classification_with_limited_labels_using_Constrained_Clustering_for_large_datasets)

This repository contains the code related to the UMN CSCI 8523: AI for Earth class project.
