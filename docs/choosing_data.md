# Choosing the data

### Intro
Our goal is to determine how much the model (SLTL_C..) is affected by spatial heterogeneity. We will do this by
* Training the model $M$ the same way as done in Praveen et.al.
* Testing the performance of $M$ with the same data as done with Praveen 
* Testing the performance of $M$ with data from a different location 

To do this, we need the following data:

1. Data $D_{o}$ used by Praveen et.al..
2. Data $D_{n}$ from a different location that is as similar as possible to $D_{o}$ but is in a different spatial region. 

### 0. Water-body classifications and sizes
* water body classes
* water body sizes
* labels
* size of data
* size of time series

### 1. Data used by Praveen et.al.

### 2. Data from a different location 

The data $D_{n}$ should be from a different location but be as similar as possible to the one used in the paper, $D_{o}$. By this, we mean it should have a similar class distribution, water-body size distribution, and time distribution as $D_{o}$.

The labeled data shared to us is from _ regions ...

We explore this data in the `/AI_for_Earth_Water-body_Classification/notebooks/choosing_data.ipynb` notebobok, and settle on __.
